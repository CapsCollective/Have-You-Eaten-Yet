Ke: Thanks for the food. I haven’t had any time to cook lately. 
Ke: With things so busy at work, and with my son… 
Peng: Is he still sick? 
Ke: A little better now, but still coughing. 
Peng: Do you have pears at home? 
Ke: Pears? 
Peng: Yeah. The big round yellow ones are best. 
Peng: Boil them with rock sugar. Add some goji berries if you have them. 
Peng: That will treat the cough. 
Ke: How does it work? 
Peng: I don’t know. But it’s what my parents taught me.
Peng: And it tastes really good, so your son will like it.  
Peng: My mother used to say it was the best part of getting sick! 
Ke: Thank you. I’ll let you know how it goes.
