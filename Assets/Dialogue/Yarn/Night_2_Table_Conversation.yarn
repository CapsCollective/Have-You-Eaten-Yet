<<wait 7>>
Brick: God, the kids these days.
Lila: Yeah. Tell me about it. 
Brick: We have “No Skating” signs up everywhere, and yet. I had to confiscate two boards today. 
Brick: Told them to pick them up tomorrow. 
<<wait 1>>
Lila: Where are you keeping the skateboards? 
Brick: They’re in the cupboard in the tearoom. Beneath the instant coffee nobody uses. 
Lila: Hmm. 
<<wait 1>>
Lila: You should try skating. Go to the rooftop carpark, while it’s empty. 
Brick: Honestly, I have thought about trying. But I shouldn’t. 
Lila: Are you scared of injuring yourself? 
Brick: Not exactly.
Lila: Then what are you worried about? 
Brick: You’re going to think I’m crazy. I’m worried I’ll enjoy myself.
Brick: Or maybe like. It’s been so long since I remember trying something new. 
Brick: What if I find it so fun, that tonight becomes the most memorable night of my life?  
Lila: Why is that such a bad thing? 
Brick: It’s not bad. It’s just… 
<<wait 0.5>>
Brick: big. 
Lila: Mmm. 
Brick: One of the things I like about this job is that it’s the same every day. 
Brick: I don’t like feeling out of my element. 
<<wait 1>>
Lila: How about. If you try skateboarding tonight, I’ll try it with you. 
Brick: Really? You’ll stack it. 
Lila: I definitely will. But when else will we get a chance to try?
Brick: Wow. Really? Okay. Let’s go then.
