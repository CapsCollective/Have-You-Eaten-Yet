L: You need to study hard, otherwise you will be working in a place like this. 
G: What’s wrong with working here?
L: It is a low life. No respect. 
G: Why? 
L: I used to work in a restaurant while I was younger. 
L: It was hard. Late nights every day. Trust me, you don’t want to live like that. 
G: But did you get to wake up later? 
L: Yes. I would start in the afternoon.
G: That doesn’t sound so bad. 
L: It was, you just have to trust me. 
L: And promise to study hard, ok?

G: ...
G: Ok. 
L: Good girl. 
L: Okay, tidy up and let’s go. We’ll be late for your lesson.
