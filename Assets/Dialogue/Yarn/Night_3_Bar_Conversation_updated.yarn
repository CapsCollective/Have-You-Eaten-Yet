Peng: Here’s a few containers of food. 
Peng: Share them with the other staff. 
Lila: It’s okay, you don’t have to - 
Peng: No, I insist. We’re trying to use up everything tonight. 
Peng: Otherwise it will all go to waste. 
Lila: Thank you. 
Peng: Once we close up, let’s start packing the tables and chairs away. 
Peng: Ah. You know it’s funny. It feels very ordinary, tonight. 
Lila: What do you mean? 
Peng: I think I imagined the last night of this restaurant would be a big party. 
Peng: We’ve been open more than ten years, after all. 
Peng: I thought everyone would come and celebrate. 
<<wait 1>>
Lila: Will everything fit in the truck? 
Peng: We can do half the furniture in one trip. 
Peng: Then we’ll come back later tonight. 
Lila: Are you sure you can handle it yourself? 
Peng: The storage facility closes at midnight, which gives us plenty of time. 
Peng: Sorry that we’re keeping you back late. 
Peng: You should take some more food! Bring some back to your family. 
Lila: Actually… 
Lila: It’s just myself, right now. 
Peng: Keep some in the freezer then! 
Lila: No it’s really fine - but thank you though. 
Lila: I’ll help you move some boxes down. It’s the least I can do. 
Peng: Ah, thank you. Everyone here is always so kind. I’ll miss it.
