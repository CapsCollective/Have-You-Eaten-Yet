Jane: I hope the chef doesn’t notice me. 
Ken: Which one? 
Jane: Shh! Not too loud. And don’t look. 
Ken: Why? What happened? 
Jane: Well… last time I was here… a few months back…
Jane: You know how after you close up on a Thursday and you’re tired, and this place is the last to close… 
Ken: Yeah? 
Jane: So I sat down, and the waiter poured me tea and gave me a menu. 
Jane: I started sipping their tea, but it was too hot and I spilt half the cup on myself. 
Jane: And I was embarrassed, so I got up and left. 
<<wait 1>>
Ken: That’s it? 
Jane: I was a waste of tea! A tea thief! 
Ken: You said it was months ago. They won’t remember.
Ken: And if they did, they wouldn’t care. 
Jane: What if they do though? 
Ken: So what were you going to do, never eat here again? 
<<wait 1>>
Jane: …Maybe? 
Ken: That would be so much worse for their business! 
Jane: I don’t owe them anything! 
Ken: I’m beginning to see why this problem might have occurred in the first place…
<<wait 1>>
Jane: Let’s just hurry and finish and get out of here.
